Abstract  
Basically it is an educational institutanal platform powered by llm th is needs 
to be particular for a single institution . So  as teachers can upload pdfs and 
text to the llm so it will store every details in the vector database so it contains 
every data for eg it contains the project report of past  3 years students and 
now we a re uploading a report and checking any similar report is present so it 
will check through the previous uploaded document and give response 
through llm
